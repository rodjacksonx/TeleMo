TeleMo is a communication module intended for use with version 6.x of Drupal, and (optionally) version 2.x of Ubercart.

This module simplifies access to various APIs from different companies offering telephony services; currently it handles the APIs from CallFire.com and Twilio.com. The intention is to allow the website developer to sign up with one (or more) telephony services, and to change between them as needed, without requiring any changes to code. And as implied, this design should also allow developers of service-specific modules, such as TeleMo SMS, to maintain such modules (or develop new ones) without concern for the specific API on the backend. Of course, all this means the access to specific service will come from extending modules; TeleMo has very little immediate usage on its own.

Documentation of an "internal API" for the development of extending modules accessing specific services is also included with this module.
